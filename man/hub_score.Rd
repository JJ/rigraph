\usage{
authority_score(
  graph,
  scale = TRUE,
  weights = NULL,
  options = arpack_defaults()
)

hub_score(graph, scale = TRUE, weights = NULL, options = arpack_defaults())
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{The input graph.}

\item{scale}{Logical scalar, whether to scale the result to have a maximum
score of one. If no scaling is used then the result vector has unit length
in the Euclidean norm.}

\item{weights}{Optional positive weight vector for calculating weighted
scores. If the graph has a \code{weight} edge attribute, then this is used
by default.
This function interprets edge weights as connection strengths. In the
random surfer model, an edge with a larger weight is more likely to be
selected by the surfer.}

\item{options}{A named list, to override some ARPACK options. See
\code{\link[=arpack]{arpack()}} for details.}
